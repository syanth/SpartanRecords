Tracks players' stats on Halo: Custom Edition and ranks them.

### Installation

Place the DLL into the controls folder of the game. From there it will read the game's memory and send it to the server, which will hopefully be up soon.

### Requirements

Any version of Halo: Custom Edition. Visual Studio 2017 to compile the DLL.
